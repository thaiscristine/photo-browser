## :rocket: About the assignment

This assignment had as challenge to build a small photo browser app pulling data from the RESTful API [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
Building this application I had the opportunity to build new components, learn more about Context and Hooks from React, and of course, play with styled-components to build modern layouts.

## Live
The current demo version is provided using Netlify in this link: [https://photobrowser-thais.netlify.app/](https://photobrowser-thais.netlify.app/).

## Installation
Use the package manager yarn to install the necessary packages.

`yarn`

## Usage
Great! Now to run the application you just need to run on terminal the followed command:

`yarn start`


### Technologies used
- TypeScript
- React
- Axios
- Styled Components
- EsLint
- polished
- react-icons
- @unform

### Functionalities of the application

- **`List Available Photo Albums`**
- **`List Photos Of Choosen Album`**
- **`Individul Per Available Photo`**

### Functionalities to implement in the future

- **`Login & Logout`**
- **`Profile Page Content`**
